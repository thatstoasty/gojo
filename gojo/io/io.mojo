# Reader is the interface that wraps the basic Read method.
#
# Read reads up to len(p) bytes into p. It returns the number of bytes
# read (0 <= n <= len(p)) and any error encountered. Even if Read
# returns n < len(p), it may use all of p as scratch space during the call.
# If some data is available but not len(p) bytes, Read conventionally
# returns what is available instead of waiting for more.
#
# When Read encounters an error or end-of-file condition after
# successfully reading n > 0 bytes, it returns the number of
# bytes read. It may return the (non-nil) error from the same call
# or return the error (and n == 0) from a subsequent call.
# An instance of this general case is that a Reader returning
# a non-zero number of bytes at the end of the input stream may
# return either err == EOF or err == nil. The next Read should
# return 0, EOF.
#
# Callers should always process the n > 0 bytes returned before
# considering the error err. Doing so correctly handles I/O errors
# that happen after reading some bytes and also both of the
# allowed EOF behaviors.
#
# If len(p) == 0, Read should always return n == 0. It may return a
# non-nil error if some error condition is known, such as EOF.
#
# Implementations of Read are discouraged from returning a
# zero byte count with a nil error, except when len(p) == 0.
# Callers should treat a return of 0 and nil as indicating that
# nothing happened; in particular it does not indicate EOF.
#
# Implementations must not retain p.

# [seek_end] means relative to the end
# (for example, offset = -2 specifies the penultimate byte of the file).
# Seek returns the new offset relative to the start of the
# file or an error, if any.

# Seeking to an offset before the start of the file is an error.
# Seeking to any positive offset may be allowed, but if the new offset exceeds
# the size of the underlying object the behavior of subsequent I/O operations

#
# When ReadAt returns n < len(p), it returns a non-nil error
