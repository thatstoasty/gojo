#     # Header maps header keys to values. If the response had multiple
#     # headers with the same key, they may be concatenated, with comma
#     # delimiters.  (RFC 7230, section 3.2.2 requires that multiple headers
#     # be semantically equivalent to a comma-delimited sequence.) When
#     # Header values are duplicated by other fields in this struct (e.g.,
#     # ContentLength, TransferEncoding, Trailer), the field values are
#     # authoritative.
#     #
#     # Keys in the map are canonicalized (see CanonicalHeaderKey).

#     # Body represents the response body.
#     #
#     # The response body is streamed on demand as the Body field
#     # is read. If the network connection fails or the server
#     # terminates the response, Body.Read calls return an error.
#     #
#     # The http Client and Transport guarantee that Body is always
#     # non-nil, even on responses without a body or responses with
#     # a zero-length body. It is the caller's responsibility to
#     # close Body. The default HTTP client's Transport may not
#     # reuse HTTP/1.x "keep-alive" TCP connections if the Body is
#     # not read to completion and closed.
#     #
#     # The Body is automatically dechunked if the server replied
#     # with a "chunked" Transfer-Encoding.
#     #
#     # As of Go 1.12, the Body will also implement io.Writer
#     # on a successful "101 Switching Protocols" response,
#     # as used by WebSockets and HTTP/2's "h2c" mode.
#     var Body: io.ReadCloser  # TODO: This should be a concrete ReadCloser, not a trait

#     # ContentLength records the length of the associated content. The
#     # value -1 indicates that the length is unknown. Unless Request.Method
#     # is "HEAD", values >= 0 indicate that the given number of bytes may
#     # be read from Body.
#     var ContentLength: Int64

#     # # Contains transfer encodings from outer-most to inner-most. Value is
#     # # nil, means that "identity" encoding is used.
#     # TransferEncoding DynamicVector[String]

#     # Close records whether the header directed that the connection be
#     # closed after reading Body. The value is advice for clients: neither
#     # ReadResponse nor Response.Write ever closes a connection.
#     var Close: Bool

#     # # Uncompressed reports whether the response was sent compressed but
#     # # was decompressed by the http package. When true, reading from
#     # # Body yields the uncompressed content instead of the compressed
#     # # content actually set from the server, ContentLength is set to -1,
#     # # and the "Content-Length" and "Content-Encoding" fields are deleted
#     # # from the responseHeader. To get the original response from
#     # # the server, set Transport.DisableCompression to true.
#     # Uncompressed bool

#     # # Trailer maps trailer keys to values in the same
#     # # format as Header.
#     # #
#     # # The Trailer initially contains only nil values, one for
#     # # each key specified in the server's "Trailer" header
#     # # value. Those values are not added to Header.
#     # #
#     # # Trailer must not be accessed concurrently with Read calls
#     # # on the Body.
#     # #
#     # # After Body.Read has returned io.EOF, Trailer will contain
#     # # any trailer values sent by the server.
#     # Trailer Header

#     # Request is the request that was sent to obtain this Response.
#     # Request's Body is nil (having already been consumed).
#     # This is only populated for Client requests.
#     # var Request: Request

#     # # TLS contains information about the TLS connection on which the
#     # # response was received. It is nil for unencrypted responses.
#     # # The poInter is shared between responses and should not be
#     # # modified.
