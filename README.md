# gojo

Experiments in porting over Golang stdlib into Mojo.

It will not always be a 1:1 port, it's more so code inspired by the Golang stdlib and the Mojo community's code. This is not intended to be a full port, but rather a learning exercise and a way to experiment with Mojo's capabilities. Please feel free to contribute or use this as a starting point for your own projects! The codebase will remain in flux and will evolve with Mojo as future releases are created.

## Installation

1. First, you'll need to configure your `mojoproject.toml` file to include my Conda channel. Add `"https://repo.prefix.dev/mojo-community"` to the list of channels.
2. Next, add `gojo` to your project's dependencies by running `magic add gojo`.
3. Finally, run `magic install` to install in `gojo`. You should see the `.mojopkg` files in `$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/mojo/`.

## What this includes

All of these packages are partially implemented and do not support unicode characters until Mojo supports them.

- `bufio`
  - `Reader`: Buffered `io.Reader`
  - `Scanner`: Scanner interface to read data via tokens.
- `bytes`
  - `Buffer`: Buffer backed by `UnsafePointer[UInt8]`.
  - `Reader`: Reader backed by `UnsafePointer[UInt8]`.
- `io`
  - Traits: `Reader`, `Writer`, `Seeker`, `Closer`, `ReadWriter`, `ReadCloser`, `WriteCloser`, `ReadWriteCloser`, `ReadSeeker`, `ReadSeekCloser`, `WriteSeeker`, `ReadWriteSeeker`, `ReaderFrom`, `WriterReadFrom`, `WriterTo`, `ReaderWriteTo`, `ReaderAt`, `WriterAt`, `ByteReader`, `ByteScanner`, `ByteWriter`, `StringWriter`
  - `Reader` and `Writer` wrapper functions.
  - `FileWrapper`: `FileHandle` Wrapper Reader/Writer
  - `STDOUT/STDERR` Writer (leveraging `libc`).
- `strings`
  - `StringBuilder`: String builder for fast string concatenation.
  - `Reader`: String reader.
- `fmt`
  - Basic `sprintf` function.
- `syscall`
  - External call wrappers for `libc` functions and types.
- `net`
  - `Socket`: Wraps `FileDescriptor` and implements network specific functions.
  - `FileDescriptor`: File Descriptor wrapper that implements `io.Writer`, `io.Reader`, and `io.Closer`.
  - `Dial` and `Listen` functions. (for TCP and UDP only atm).
